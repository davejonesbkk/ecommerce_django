Why not pandas?

Another answer suggests:

Why not use pandas?
Pandas is a common library, but it's not in the standard library. Adding it as a dependency is non-trivial.

There are builtin solutions for this use-case in the list object itself as well as in the standard library.

If your project does not already require pandas, it would be foolish to make it a requirement just for this functionality.
